# WeatherDashboard


## Description

- The motivation was to create a page that displays the weather conditions in the city of choice plus a five day forecast
- The project was built to improve the knowledge with the bootstrap framework, get to know how to work and retrieve inforamtion from API's hosted on
  foreign servers. 
- The API gives the opportunity to retreive a fast overview of weather conditions in cities worldwide.
- Retrieve information from server-side-api's, dynamically create elements and continue to work with localStorage and JavaScript.

## Usage

In the search mask you can input a city and search for it. The API displays the current weather and the forecast for the following five days.
In addition it saves up to 10 City links as short-cut buttons. By clicking on them it will automatically display the weather again.
